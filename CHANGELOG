New in version 0.1.0:
    * When using reverse DNS on log messages, now you only have to see the
        hostname part of the resolved name instead of the whole FQDN
        unless you enable a new option (dns_keep_fqdn).
    * Hostnames resolved via reverse DNS now go into email subjects.
    * A little bit more documentation, including example rsyslog conf.

New in verison 0.0.9:
	* Reverse DNS on log messages. New config options controlling this:
		dns_lookup (bool), dns_timeout (hopefully much less than 
		relay_delay), dns_batch_limit (64?).

New in verison 0.0.8:
	* The Mail module had two bugs, one preventing newlines from appearing
		in outgoing mails in some cases, the other showing IPs in the
		e-mail subject that may not actually appear in syslogs included
		in that e-mail.  Both bugs hopefully squashed.

New in version 0.0.7:
	* The Mail module will now filter out repetition of the same IP
		addresses within a single syslog message, to save space.  This
		issue manifests itself due to filter I've provided for use
		by syslog-ng to pass messages along to fitful.  When a device
		doesn't know or doesn't publish its own hostname in its syslog
		message, the IP fills slots for both, making the message
		unnecessarily long.

New in version 0.0.6:
	* Mail finally displays correctly in Outlook.  This is the problem
		that I at first wrongly blamed on Exchange or BES.  Line breaks
		appeared to be missing not because of anything wrong with
		quoted-printable, but because of Outlook's silly feature
		to arbitrarily remove 'extra' line breaks.  This was corrected
		with an equally silly kludge that adds a tab right before the
		line break for lines of syslog in the email.  That seems to
		tell Outlook not to remove the line break.  Thanks Shawn!

New in version 0.0.5:
	* PID file location is now configurable.  This makes it easy to run
		fitfuld as a non-root user if you choose a file path that
		doesn't need root permissions to be written to.
	* Mail subject prefix is now configurable.
	* Mail is no longer MIME quoted-printable.  It is hoped this will
		fix a problem where emails seem to be missing line breaks when
		transferred through Exchange (and a BES?).

New in version 0.0.4:
	* Removed the whole named pipe/'fitfulr' business and turned the
		fitfuld program into a TCP server (listens by default on
		localhost:4955).
	* Send email with CRLF's like a good citizen (definitely necessary
		when SMTP relay is Micro$oft).
	* The Mail relay module now greps syslog lines for hostnames and IPs
		and will add them to the subject line of the email if there aren't
		too many distinct IPs and hostnames per message (limit 5).  This
		depends on the syslog messages arriving in the right format (see
		the "syslog-ng template" section of the INSTALL file.
