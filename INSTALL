The four commands at the end of this file should work if you have all the
necessary dependencies.

Those dependencies are:
	Some kind of modern decent Linux
	A reasonably modern version of syslog-ng that you can configure freely
	Perl >= 5.8
	Config::General
	Mail::Sendmail
	Proc::Daemon
	Net::DNS

As for those dependencies that are perl modules, you can install them
either via your distributions package manager, if it provides them, or
via CPAN.

Here are those four commands you need.  Run the first two as a regular user,
and the last two as root.

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
# make install
# ./install-conf.pl


*** syslog-ng template ***
It's up to you what sources and filters you use, but your 'destination'
block in your syslog-ng configuration should look like this:

destination mydest {
	tcp (
		"localhost"
		port (4955)
		template ("$DATE [$SOURCEIP ($HOST)] <$FACILITY.$PRIORITY> $MSG\n")
	);
};
