The four commands at the end of this file should work if you have all the
necessary dependencies.

Those dependencies are:
	Some kind of modern decent Linux
	A reasonably modern version of syslog-ng that you can configure freely
	Perl >= 5.8
	Config::General
	Mail::Sendmail
	Proc::Daemon
	Net::DNS

As for those dependencies that are perl modules, you can install them
either via your distributions package manager, if it provides them, or
via CPAN.

Here are those four commands you need.  Run the first two as a regular user,
and the last two as root.

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
# make install
# ./install-conf.pl


*** syslog-ng template ***
It's up to you what sources and filters you use, but your 'destination'
block in your syslog-ng configuration should look like this:

destination mydest {
	tcp (
		"localhost"
		port (4955)
		template ("$DATE [$SOURCEIP ($HOST)] <$FACILITY.$PRIORITY> $MSG\n")
	);
};


*** rsyslog configuration ***
If you're using rsyslog instead of syslog-ng, you want a configuration like
this one:

$template fitful,"%timegenerated% [%FROMHOST% (%HOSTNAME%)] <%syslogseverity-text%> %syslogtag%%msg%"
*.*    @@127.0.0.1:4955;fitful

That would send all your syslog messages to a fitful instance on localhost, so
you might replace the *.* with something else depending on your situation.
