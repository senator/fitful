The server
----------

fitfuld is a daemon that should always run, listening for log
messages to be relayed to it by syslog-ng and dispatching
them appropriately.

fitfuld has 'relay' modules, each of which has a configuration. The only
module activated by default has a special hard-coded configuration for
performance reasons.  Other modules get their configurations from
text files at /etc/fitful/modules/<lowercasemodulename>.conf.  The
(no-op) module "Text" has the typical configuration that extension
modules would use.

fitfuld is multi-threaded.  It listens on a TCP socket for incoming
lines sent by syslog-ng.  It queues these.  Another thread periodically takes
the contents of the queue, sends it to all modules (only Mail is active by
default), and clears the queue at a regular interval.
