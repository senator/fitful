* When using rDNS on hosts reported by IP only in log messages, send only
    the hostname rather than the FQDN in emails.
* Use these hostnames from rDNS in email subjects
* Reformat CHANGELOG in GNU format.
* Apply GPL more clearly and widely throughout files.
* Move the just-added filtering of redundant IP addresses in the syslog
	messages in the Mail module up into some more central place.  There's
	no reason for that behavior to be specific to the mail module.
* Maybe set e-mail priority based on syslog priority.
* Add command line options in addition to more conf-file-configurable things.
* Clean out some unused code left over from fitfulr ($prepend, etc...)
